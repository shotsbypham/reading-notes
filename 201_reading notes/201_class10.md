# Readings: Debugging

## What Went Wrong? Troubleshooting JavaScript

Name some key differences between a Syntax Error and a Logic Error.

- Syntax Error: mainly spelling errors
- Logic Error: code is not what you intended it to be and produces the wrong results.

List a few types of errors that you have encountered in past lab assignments and explain how you were able to correct them.

- Syntax errors: I often miss one or two closing brackets and I started formatting my documents and using the terminal to check for errors.
- Logic errors: I usually read the code in plain english to see if Iâ€™m plugging the right elements into the right place.

How will this topic continue to influence your long term goals?

- This shows that debugging is a job itself, it is helpful to check code piece by piece instead of writing a whole bunch of code and not knowing where the problem is.

## The JavaScript Debugger

How would you describe the JavaScript Debugger tool and how it works to someone just starting out in software development?

- The JavaScript Debugger lets you see your code working piece by piece and allows you to identify the problems easily.

Define what a breakpoint is.

- Breakpoints let you pause execution of code and help you determine which part of your code is breaking.

What is the call stack?

- Call stack shows you what code has been executed so far.
