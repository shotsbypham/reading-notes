## Introduction To Events

How would you describe events to a non-technical friend?

- Event listeners are like a sound board, you click the button and depending on what the button is programmed for it will trigger that specific program.

When using the addEventListener() method, what 2 arguments will you need to provide?

- Type: the name of the event the eventlistener is waiting for
- Listener: What receives the trigger

Describe the event object. Why is the target within the event object useful?

- It is a parameter that gets plugged into the event handler, it helps pass on information from the event object to the event handler.

What is the difference between event bubbling and event capturing?

- The capturing phase checks from the outside in while bubbling checks from inside out, the capturing phase checks the main parent first but bubbling checks the direct parent and outwards.
