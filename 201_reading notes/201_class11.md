# Readings: Audio, Video, Images

## Video and Audio Content

Explain how the ability to use video and audio on the web has evolved since the early 2000s.

- HTML did not have the ability to embed video and audio into web pages. Also video and audio files are much larger than images so we needed a bigger bandwidth to process those files.

Describe the use of the src and controls attributes in the video element.

- Src: like image files and indicates the source of the video.
- Controls: used for audio and video playback, start, stop, and adjust volume.

Why is it important to have fallback content inside the video element?

- Allows for browsers that don't support the video element to fallback onto older browsers.
