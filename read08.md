# Read: 08 - Operators and Loops

## Expressions and operators

Operators:

### _Assignment Operators_

assigns a value to its left operand based on the value on its right operand

'oprand1 operator operand2'
    3       +       4  
the + is the assignment operator

### _Comparison operators_

- == is true if the operands are equal
- != is true if the operands are NOT equal
- === is true if operands are equal and of the same type
- !== true if the operands are of the same type but not equal
- '>' greater than
- '>=' greater than or equal
- '<' less than
- '<=' less than or equal

## Loops and iteration

- for statements: repeats ubntil specified condition evalutes to false
- when we know how many times we want the code to run
- for(let i = 0;)

a _for_ statement looks like:
for ([intialExpression]; [conditionExpression]; [incrementExpression]) statement

- while statements: executes its statement as long as it evaluates to true
