What is a text editor?

2. writing html and css efficently: extensions like Emmet can help speed up your code writing faster.
3. syntax highlighting: feature that helps the text more noticeable by changing the color, helps you see errors faster.

### Linux Tutorial
Shortcuts:
- cd[location] stands for change directory
- pwd --> print working directory (where are we currently)
- ls --> list the contents of a directory
- file --> obtain information about what type of file a file or directory is
- ls -a --> list the contents of a directory, including hidden files
Important concepts: 
- Relative path (from where we currently are) 
- Absolute path (from the room of the file system) 
- Everything is a file under Linux (even directories) 
- Linux is an extentionless system (Files can have an extension they like or none at all) 
- Linux is case sensitive (Beware of silly typos)
