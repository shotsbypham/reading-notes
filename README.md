**What is growth mindset?**

A growth mindset is a view on how to approach new things in life. It is embracing new challenges and opportunities that may come with different obstacles that you go through. The amount of effort you put in is going to determine the result that comes out. It also means that you need to learn through feedback and criticism instead of ignorning it. 

_Reminders to keep yourself in a growth mindset:_
- It's okay to run into obstacles since growth isn't linear.
- Don't avoid challenges!
- Learn from criticism instead of ignoring it!
- ~~Just give up!~~

Self Introduction:
Hello! My name is Trina Pham and I am based in Seattle, WA. I recently dropped out of my undergraduate program after studying Asian American Studies and Political Science for 2 years. During the pandemic, I picked up gaming and streaming as a hobby, which peaked my interest in the tech industry. I am joining the in-person Code Fellows program this month and am looking forward to learn how to code!
