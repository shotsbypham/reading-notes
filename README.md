# Self Introduction

Hello! My name is Trina Pham and I am based in Seattle, WA. I recently dropped out of my undergraduate program after studying Asian American Studies and Political Science for 2 years. During the pandemic, I picked up gaming and streaming as a hobby, which peaked my interest in the tech industry. I am joining the in-person Code Fellows program this month and am looking forward to learn how to code!
